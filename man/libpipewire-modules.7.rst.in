DESCRIPTION
===========

A PipeWire module is effectively a PipeWire client running inside
``pipewire(1)`` which can host multiple modules. Usually modules are
loaded when they are listed in the configuration files. For example
the default configuration file loads several modules:

::

    context.modules = [
        ...
        # The native communication protocol.
        {   name = libpipewire-module-protocol-native }
    
        # The profile module. Allows application to access profiler
        # and performance data. It provides an interface that is used
        # by pw-top and pw-profiler.
        {   name = libpipewire-module-profiler }
    
        # Allows applications to create metadata objects. It creates
        # a factory for Metadata objects.
        {   name = libpipewire-module-metadata }
    
        # Creates a factory for making devices that run in the
        # context of the PipeWire server.
        {   name = libpipewire-module-spa-device-factory }
        ...
    ]
